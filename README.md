An experimental gallery for [garyc.me/sketch](https://garyc.me/sketch).
<br>
A live version of it can be found on [quackbarc.github.io/garyc&#8209;alt&#8209;gallery](https://quackbarc.github.io/garyc-alt-gallery).
<br>
As you can see, the whole project's living under one HTML. I'll get to untangling that sooner or later, I promise.
